This repository is divided into three main parts, each contained within its own folder.

#### ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

1.  Question_1
2.  Question_2
3.  Question_3

## Question_1:

This section contains a Colab notebook that implements and documents a core iterative algorithm used in this project. All steps and logic are detailed within the notebook.

## Question_2:

This part focuses on the extraction and analysis of key variables. We process geospatial and orientation data to determine the power variable resolution.

The key variables extracted are:
1. Latitude
2. Longitude
3. Bearing
4. Inclination

## Question_3:

This is the most crucial part of the project. It contains the formulation and solution for the main optimization problem.
All details, mathematical models, methodologies, and relevant references are thoroughly documented in the accompanyingÂ ColabÂ notebook.
